# Gate2Triger

This is a Quad Kosmo Format Gate to Trigger Module , only fit RV1 or R1. RV1 is really for initial tweeking of the trigger point the fixed resistor can be used instead.
Ideally you should use a dual trace scope to get your trigger nice and sharp.

It's named "The LLoyd Peck" after the famous british actor who played Trigger in the TV Show "Only Fools and Horses"
